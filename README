The project provides a set of well-defined endpoints that allow clients
to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books
using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

The project follows the principles of REST, such as using unique resource identifiers (URIs)
to identify resources, using standard HTTP methods to manipulate resources,
and returning data in a standard data format such as JSON.

By following these principles, the project promotes scalability, flexibility,
and loose coupling between the client and server components of a web application.
It allows clients to interact with the API using a wide range of programming languages
and platforms, and it enables developers to evolve the API over time without breaking backward compatibility.
